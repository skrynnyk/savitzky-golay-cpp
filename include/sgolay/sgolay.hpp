 * @brief      This is a header-only implementation of the Slavitzky-Golay
 *             Filter, backed by Gram polynomials for convolution weight
 *             generation based on a paper by Peter A. Gorry "General
 *             Least-Squares Smoothing and Differentiation by the Convolution
 *             (Savitzky-Golay) Method".
